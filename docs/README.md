# OHM MVP Frontend – Code Snippets

This folder contains PDF exports of code snippets for different sections of the MVP frontend.
They are intended as reference material while we stitch pages together and activate links.

For the canonical implementation, always refer to the actual source files in this repository.
These PDFs are a temporary design and implementation aid.
